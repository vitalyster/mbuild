This directory contains the source and modifications to GNU Make to enable it to be
used to build Firefox.

This directory contains source archives for GNU Make that were exported from
its canonical Git repository at git://git.savannah.gnu.org/make.git, with the
following command, and further bzip2'ed:
    git archive -o make-`git describe HEAD`.tar --format=tar --prefix=make-`git describe HEAD`/ HEAD

To obtain the source, extract the vanilla/unmodified make-*.tar.bz2 source
archive. Then apply the patches from the NNNN-*.patch files in this directory
in order (make sure to use version 2.7 or newer of the patch utility).

To build, open make_msvc_net2003.sln in Visual Studio. Go to the configuration
manager and ensure the "release" configuration (not the "debug" configuration)
is active. Then build and take the resulting "Release/make_msvc_net2003.exe"
and rename it to "mozmake.exe" and install.

Patches in this directory are licensed under the same license as the GNU make
source code. For more info, view the COPYING file in the GNU make source
archive.
