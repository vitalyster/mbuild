"""Perform clones by first downloading static bundles.

Cloning large repositories can be resource intensive on the server because
Mercurial needs to work to serve that data.

This extension relieves some of that load by changing clone to first obtain
a pre-generated bundle file. Since the bundle file is pre-generated and
serving static files should not be as resource intensive as producing a
bundle at clone time, this results in a net reduction of server work.

Client Use
==========

To enable cloning from bundles, simply enable this extension on the client.

If the server supports bundle clones and a bundle is available, it will be
used. If not, there is no change in behavior.

The ``bundleclone.pullmanifest`` boolean config flag can be set to enable
pulling the bundleclone manifest from the server during clone and pull
operations. It is not enabled by default.

Server Use
==========

During clone, the contents of .hg/bundleclone.manifest are transferred to the
client and parsed for suitable bundles.

Each line in this file defines an available bundle. Lines have the format:

    <URL> [<key>=<value]

That is, a URL followed by extra metadata describing it. Metadata keys and
values should be URL encoded.

This metadata is optional. It is up to server operators to populate this
metadata. See below for use cases.

The server operator is responsible for generating the bundle manifest file.

While the bundle manifest can consist of multiple lines, the client will
currently only consult the first line unless attribute preferences are
defined. See below.

Using Stream Bundles
--------------------

Mercurial has an alternative clone mode accessed via
``hg clone --uncompressed`` that effectively streams raw files across the wire.
This is conceptually similar to streaming a tar file. Assuming the network is
not limiting throughput, this clone mode is significantly faster because it
consumes much less CPU (the client is effectively writing files from a buffer).
The downside to this approach is total size of transferred data is slightly
larger. But in environments with plentiful bandwidth and high throughput, this
trade-off is often worth it.

To produce stream bundles (which aren't technically Mercurial bundles), you'll
need to run the following command:

    $ hg streambundle <output file>

Manifest entries for stream bundles *must* contain a ``stream`` attribute
whose value contains a comma delimited list of requirements. This content will
be printed by the ``streambundle`` command.

Generating the Bundle Manifest
------------------------------

Before you generate the bundle manifest, you must first generate a bundle.
This can be done with the ``hg bundle`` command.

A bundle with gzip compression will behave most similarly to what Mercurial
does by default at clone time. bzip2 bundles will be smaller (they will
transfer faster) but will require more CPU to generate and apply. For large
repos, this could significantly increase clone time.

A recommended bundle generation command that gets you close to Mercurial
defaults is:

    $ hg bundle --all --type gzip bundle.hg

You have the choice of using a static filename / URL with an ever-changing
file/bundle underneath or using separate files/URLs backed by constant
content. The former keeps your ``bundle.manifest`` files static. The latter
has significant advantages for HTTP, including more reliable resume support
and better support for caching. With idempotent HTTP GETs, you can set
aggressive Cache-Control headers to enable downstream caching. The choice
is yours.

If you want to produce separate files/URLs for each bundle, we recommend
including the tip changeset as part of the filename. For example:

    $ hg bundle --all --type gzip `hg log --template '{node|short}' -r tip`.hg

From there, make the bundle file available where the client can access it and
place that URL in the ``.hg/bundleclone.manifest`` file. e.g.:

    https://example.com/bundles/d31fe614fa1e.hg

Using Attributes to Prefer Bundles
==================================

Manifest may define attributes next to each entry. Attributes can be used by
clients to *prefer* one bundle over another. For example, a client on a slow
internet connection may wish to prefer bzip2 bundles because they are smaller.
Or, a server operator may wish to hosts bundles in S3 in multiple EC2 regions
and have clients fetch from the closest EC2 region. Assigning the compression
format and/or EC2 region to an attribute could allow clients to fetch the best
bundle for them.

As described above, attributes simply need to be set in the bundle manifest
file on the server.

To use these attributes, clients will need to define the
``bundleclone.prefers`` config option. This option is a list of ``key=value``
pairs that define attribute names and their preferred values. e.g.::

    [bundleclone]
    prefers = ec2region=us-west-1 ec2region=us-east-1 compression=gzip

The client sorts the server-provided manifest according to preferences defined
in ``bundleclone.prefers``. The sorting method is very simple: an entry is
preferred over another the earlier a match in the attributes list occurs.

In the above example, the client will select the first available from the
following:

1. a gzip2 bundle in the us-west-1 region
2. a gzip2 bundle in the us-east-1 region
3. any available bundle in us-west-1
4. any available bundle in us-east-1
5. any available gzip bundle in any region
6. any available bundle

Failure Behavior
================

By default, clients will abort if an error occurred while fetching a bundle.
The behavior can be changed to fall back to cloning via regular means by
setting the ``bundleclone.fallbackonerror`` boolean config option.

The reason clients don't fall back to a regular clone on failure is because
this may overwhelm the Mercurial server. Many reasons for deploying clone from
bundle support is to help reduce server load. A server may expect that most
clones are serviced by bundles and thus effectively free for the server to
handle. If bundles started failing all of a sudden, the server could
potentially be flooded by tons of new clone requests, drastically increasing
its load and possibly overwhelming it. Disallowing fallback on failure is a
safeguard to prevent this from happening.

SNI
===

Python < 2.7.9 does not support SNI, a TLS extension that allows multiple
SSL certificates to be installed on the same IP. Hosting services often
use SNI to enable multiple services to exist on the same IP.

In addition, Mercurial < 3.3 did not support using the modern SSL capabilities
exposed by modern Python versions. Therefore SNI does not work on Mercurial <
3.3.

The ``requiresni`` manifest attribute can be defined on the server to
indicate whether an entry requires SNI. If it is ``true`` and the client
doesn't support SNI, the entry is automatically discarded. For this reason,
server operators may want to ensure that there is a non-SNI entry in the
manifest to ensure all clients can fetch the bundles.
